##Authentication & Authorization

Web applications needs a way of knowing which users are logged into the system and what these users can and can't do. Authentication is the process of getting to know a user, this normally involves a username and a password. Authorization is the process of checking what a user can do once they are Authenticated in the system. Functionality in a system is normally breaked down into roles, with roles being assigned to users. The process goes something like this, a user is identified as they log into the system. Once a user is identified it's roles are located, the system use these roles to determine what a user can and can't do.
