#Deployment

The process of putting your application on the the internet so that it can be used by users are called deployment. 
There are various options for deploying your application.

##Some deployment options are:
* shared hosting
* a dedicated server in a data center
* a virtual private server (VPS) provided by a cloud host
* using a Platform as a Service (PaaS)

We will be focussing on the last two options VPS and PaaS.

##VPS providers

Virtual Private Servers providei you with dedicated servers in the cloud that one needs to configure oneself. 
This allows for alot of flexibility and freedom, but it does take a certain level of skills as you need to configure everything yourself. This include the firewall, database and web server setup. This sounds quite daunting, but there are a lots of tutorials online that guide you through these steps.
