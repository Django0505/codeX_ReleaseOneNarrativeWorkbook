# Data Modelling and Persistence

To write applications one need a way of storing and manipulating data, that is what databases are for. They make 
it easy to store, structure, retrieve and manage data.

## Database basics

Databases put data that belongs together in tables, each table have multiple entries with is called rows and 
each row have multiple fields.

One can link tables to each other using fields, one can create a field in one table and reference that field 
from another table. In effect one is creating relationships between tables, that's why it is called relational databases then..

## Data Modelling

The process of creating a set of tables for a problem domain is called Data Modelling. When creating a data model one 
looks at what different types of data needs to be stored and how they relate to each other.

Look at this scenario:

>> As as Taxi Owner I would like to see who is driving my taxi's and on which routes.

Answer these questions:
  * For what entities do we need to store data?
  * What data do we need for each entity?
  * How do the entities relates to each other?
